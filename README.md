SOP Management and Task Assignment System
The SOP Management and Task Assignment System is a prototype website developed to optimize task tracking, SOP adherence, and task assignment processes within the company. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project aims to improve task tracking, employee guidance, and supervisor monitoring, ultimately enhancing productivity and safety in the workplace. This platform is designed to enhance the efficiency of manufacturing operations and communication between employees and managers.

This page serves as the central hub for employees, displaying assigned tasks, allowing for SOP selection, and providing a space to log completed tasks. Employees can view instructions, submit task completion logs, and update task statuses. They will be notified of task approvals from the manager and the tasks assigned. The logout button redirects to the SOP_login.html.

This page is designed for managers, this dashboard displays employeesâ€™ task logs and provides managers with options to approve and comment on submitted tasks. Managers can monitor the progress of the tasks assigned to the employees. Also, they can assign tasks to employees that are visible in their calendars. Notifications will be received when a log is submitted by his/her subordinates and when an employee completes the task assigned. The logout button will redirect to the login page.

This system was developed as a future implementation proposal during my internship at Hirotec India Pvt. Ltd., Coimbatore. The project showcases the potential to simplify task assignments, improve task tracking, and ensure SOP compliance to enhance operational productivity.
